IDEAS

2 gangs (blue fists, yellowback vipers)
	1 has base on island, other has base accessible by truck
	Fix boat and exit left to get choices:
		Can go to shipwreck, island, etc.
	Fix truck and exit right to get different choices:
		Can go to base, farmhouse (lots of food), etc.
	From viper base, can steal heli (need to kill them all and loot for fuel or something)
	With heli, can go left or right for different options:
		Go right to get to ghost tower and finish
		Go left to get to somewhere else important?
		
	Scene transition choices in vehicles are done with weegee mission framework style stuff.
