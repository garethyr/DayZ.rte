	Description = Normally used for hunting small game, the Compound Crossbow has found a niche among survivors looking to stay silent. Although the projectile is slow, it is highly lethal. The main drawback to this weapon is its single shot, and it takes time to load another bolt. The name "Darryl" can be faintly seen scratched on the stock.
