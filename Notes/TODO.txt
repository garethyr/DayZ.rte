--TODO List (in no particular order unless otherwise stated)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------
--General--
-----------
1) Map transition to tunnel scene
	(has to be made playable before I get an idea of how deep to set the tunnels)
2) Zombie AI
3) More food/ drink items
4) Well areas/ refillable canteen
5) Zombie sprites - at least several more sets; is randomization possible (like Ronin)? --RANDOMIZATION IS DEFINITELY DOABLE
6) Remove suspense sounds (reimplement after new build's sound update?) --THEY WORK FINE AS IS?
7) Weather?
8) Separate military loot areas
	(at this point, only the ATC, two hangars, and last building on the map, but not the firehouse)
9) BG spawning for day/night backgrounds?
10) Sharpaim shenanigans for weapons
11) X amt of damage in X time - zombie ragdolls for a second to simulate stumbling --WILL COME WITH ZOMBIE AI
	(player too?)
12) NPCs?
13) Helicopter?
	(flyby along preset path until offscreen with mounted MG, shooting at player if spotted? possible?)
14) "Dodge" system
15) Beartrap
16) Fix medical box -- NEED [DZ] VERSION OF MEDICAL BOX WITH NO SCRIPT
17) Random events? (NPCs, bandit ambush, zombie hordes, etc?)
18) Bandit sprites/actor
19) Clock (days survived and/or current time?)
20) Rethink stairs?
21) Zombie climbing? (next build possible?)
22) Vomit emitter fx
23) New player condition - shaking?
	(after receiving x amt heavy damage; will throw off sharpaim when implemented; cured by (26...
24) ... Painkillers?
25) New player condition - unconsciousness?
	(after significant bloodloss or by random zombie hit; unable to move and complete fog of war for x seconds; cured by (28...
26) ... Epi-pen? (adrenaline shot) - for player, will need NPC to administer
	(could be incentive to group up w/NPCs
27) Implement more DayZ player sounds (mostly damage sounds)
28) Create other scenes for transitions (Skalisty Island; shipwreck; bandit hideout; Green Mountain)
29) Saving and loading games

----------------
--Lua Specific--
----------------
1) Make custom zombie AI (bleh)
2) Make vomit act over time
3) Fix alert bugs where they place late or in strange locations
4) Completely properly fix all crashes on death
5) Smooth out day/night transition
6) Implement light alerts disappearing and not working in day, I just realised I never even started doing this, just left a note about it lol.
7) Flesh out transitions more, determine extent of information in scene datafiles
8) Reorganize scripts - create util script for all util functions
9) Organize/Reorganize datafile parsing, allow the datafiles to use either short form names or full variable names (i.e. self.Whatever) as keys
10) Add to scene datafiles variables:
	Need section for backgrounds: self.BackgroundChanges = true/false, self.BackgroundsTotalNumber, self.BackgroundPosition must be reset on map change
	Need section for other: self.AlwaysDark = true/false
11) Add ability for comments to datafiles
12) Organize modularity - change all rte references to self.RTE (will be set as "DayZ.rte"), change all function calls to use a global variable (i.e. function ModularActivity:etc(stuff)) set in the main script

-------------
--Completed--
-------------
1) Added ammo to loot spawn
