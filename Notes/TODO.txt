--TODO List (in no particular order unless otherwise stated)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------
--General--
-----------
1) Zombie AI
2) More food/ drink items
3) Well areas/ refillable canteen
4) Zombie sprites - at least several more sets; is randomization possible (like Ronin)? --RANDOMIZATION IS DEFINITELY DOABLE
5) Remove suspense sounds (reimplement after new build's sound update?) --THEY WORK FINE AS IS?
6) Weather?
7) Separate military loot areas
	(at this point, only the ATC, two hangars, and last building on the map, but not the firehouse)
8) Sharpaim shenanigans for weapons
9) X amt of damage in X time - zombie ragdolls for a second to simulate stumbling --WILL COME WITH ZOMBIE AI
	(player too?)
10) NPCs?
11.) Helicopter? (flyby along preset path until offscreen with mounted MG, shooting at player if spotted? possible?)
12) "Dodge" system
13) Beartrap
14) Fix medical box -- NEED [DZ] VERSION OF MEDICAL BOX WITH NO SCRIPT
15) Random events? (NPCs, bandit ambush, zombie hordes, etc?)
16) Bandit sprites/actor
17) Clock (days survived and/or current time?)
18) Rethink stairs?
19) Zombie climbing? (next build possible?)
20) Vomit emitter fx
21) New player condition - shaking?
	(after receiving x amt heavy damage; will throw off sharpaim when implemented; cured by (26...
22) ... Painkillers?
23) New player condition - unconsciousness?
	(after significant bloodloss or by random zombie hit; unable to move and complete fog of war for x seconds; cured by (28...
24) ... Epi-pen? (adrenaline shot) - for player, will need NPC to administer
	(could be incentive to group up w/NPCs
25) Implement more DayZ player sounds (mostly damage sounds)
26) Create other scenes for transitions (Skalisty Island; shipwreck; bandit hideout; Green Mountain)
27) Saving and loading games
28) Remove civilization area from military base (it's open-air enough for nature sounds)
29) Add flashlight, matches, jerry can to spawn
30) Hard limit on flashlight alert level (so it can't *completely* fill the "eye" UI bar)

----------------
--Lua Specific--
----------------
1) Fix bug with setting day/night longer than 60 seconds
2) Make custom zombie AI (bleh)
3) Make vomit act over time
4) Fix alert bugs where they place late or in strange locations
5) Completely properly fix all crashes on death
6) Smooth out day/night transition
7) Implement light alerts disappearing and not working in day, I just realised I never even started doing this, just left a note about it lol.
8) Flesh out transitions more, determine extent of information in scene datafiles
9) Organize/Reorganize datafile parsing, allow the datafiles to use either short form names or full variable names (i.e. self.Whatever) as keys
10) Add to scene datafiles variables:
	Need section for backgrounds: self.BackgroundChanges = true/false, self.BackgroundsTotalNumber, self.BackgroundPosition must be reset on map change
	Need section for other: self.AlwaysDark = true/false
11) Add ability for comments to datafiles
12) Make fog of war change with level of night, so evening will be brighter than midnight, etc.
13) Allow "Drop Ammo" pie menu icon to work with any amount of ammo, not just ammo over a minimum of a full load (you come across a weapon you already have; take ammo instead of a slightly "fuller" gun) Right now you can only take ammo if you have more than the default full magazine/load for each weapon.
14) Implement MOSRotating Sun, Moon, Day/Night Clouds
	(indicate time of day by position of 	sun/moon?)
