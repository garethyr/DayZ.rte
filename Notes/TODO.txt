--TODO List (in no particular order unless otherwise stated)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



----------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------General---------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------
• More food/ drink items
• Well areas/ refillable canteen
• Zombie sprites - at least several more sets; is randomization possible (like Ronin)? --RANDOMIZATION IS DEFINITELY DOABLE
• Weather
• Sharpaim shenanigans for weapons
• X amt of damage in X time - zombie ragdolls for a second to simulate stumbling --WILL COME WITH ZOMBIE AI
	(player too?)
• NPCs
• Helicopter (flyby along preset path until offscreen with mounted MG, shooting at player if spotted? possible?)
• "Dodge" system
• Beartrap
• Bandit sprites/actor
• Rethink stairs
• Zombie climbing? (next build possible?)
• Vomit emitter fx
• New player condition - shaking?
	(after receiving x amt heavy damage; will throw off sharpaim when implemented; cured by (next entry...
• ... Painkillers?
• New player condition - unconsciousness?
	(after significant bloodloss or by random zombie hit; unable to move and complete fog of war for x seconds; cured by (next entry...
• ... Epi-pen? (adrenaline shot) - for player, will need NPC to administer
	(could be incentive to group up w/NPCs
• Implement more DayZ player sounds (mostly damage sounds)
• Create other scenes for transitions (Skalisty Island; shipwreck; bandit hideout; Green Mountain)
• Remove civilization area from military base (it's open-air enough for nature sounds)
• Add flashlight, matches, jerry can to spawn
• Add backpacks and inventory limit?
	Just a potential idea, I'm thinking we can make it so aside from the transitions on the far sides of the map needing a boat and heli, we can also have it so the friendly camp has left side transition back to chernarus and right side transition to one of the other locations, but there's a lengthy forest area which requires more supplies than one can carry without a backpack or something?
• Add localized sounds for tunnels, also maybe different global BG?
• Fix the issues about being unable to find missing presets. Apparently it's that the presets aren't defined but it somehow still works???
• Add thin but very strong borders on the edges of tunnel transitions so player can't fall out the bottom of tunnels on main map or off the sides of the tunnel map


----------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------Lua Specific----------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------
• Fix crash to desktop with setting day/night longer than 60 seconds
• Fix crash to desktop with coming back from leaving tunnels

• Use B32 features to detect when weapons are used with perfect accuracy, and apply that to all weapon use scripts

• Make custom zombie AI (bleh)
• Maybe allow behaviour targets to allow for different types of zombies, e.g. bloodhound zombie which would have a bonus to weight for human targets, or forgetful zombie which would have a mallus to weight for all targets and would change targets more often
	This would have to wait til after some amount of custom zombie ai is done and input is needed on whether or not this is a good idea. May also need some changes to zombie despawn handling

• Random events (NPCs, bandit ambush, zombie hordes, etc?)
• Make medical box work for NPCs too later, since right now it uses player only functions. Swap that when NPCs have similar functions.

• Saving and loading games

• Add scudding clouds (will go in weather module as they'll be affected by that)

• Allow "Drop Ammo" pie menu icon to work with any amount of ammo, not just ammo over a minimum of a full load (you come across a weapon you already have; take ammo instead of a slightly "fuller" gun) Right now you can only take ammo if you have more than the default full magazine/load for each weapon.
			PLEASE CLARIFY - If I'm understanding right, you want to be able to pick up a gun, unload it and have that ammo as a separate item? What's happening now?
			NEVERMIND REQUEST FOR CLARIFICATION - I get what you're saying. I'm thinking I may rework the ammo system a bit so it's less of a mess and doesn't require you to have the weapon and ammo next to each other. I'll also make ammo pickup/drop easier.

• Hard limit on flashlight alert level (so it can't *completely* fill the "eye" UI bar) --SHOULD THIS STILL BE A THING? I THINK FLASHLIGHT SHOULD CAUSE ALERTS.

• Fix recursive GetSafeRandomSpawn causing infinite loops so it can be uncommented
----------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------Completed-------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------
• Added ammo to loot spawn
• Added "Zombies killed" counter
• Added "Nights survived" counter
• Added ability for transitions to other scenes
• Added BG spawning
• Added smooth gradient to day BGs
• Added working sun and moon
• Added separate loot areas and loot sets for hospital and military areas
• Reworked transition scripts for neatness and to allow comments
• Reworked screen text display scripts for better access and handling
• Reworked player spawning so it can work dynamically based on scene areas
• Completely fixed reworked spawning so everything about the actor is saved on scene transition
• Smoothed out day/night transition so nights grow gradually more dark then less dark over time
• Reworked item scripts to be less messy and use a unified system for parent checking and effects that reduces duplicated code and clutter
• Fixed medical box to work with DayZ
• Made it so specific loot items in a set can have a low chance of spawning, for use if they're way better than the other items
• Made vomiting act over time and immobilize the vomiting actor until it's finished
• Gave zombies weighted targeting so they will change targets to closer ones with equal or higher priority (i.e. a zombie going for an alert will change to a closer human, but not the reverse)
• Made zombies react to newly made alerts differently than other targets, so that they may change their target to the alert thereby simulating suddenly distracting zombies
• Made actor meters work better on higher resolutions and changed the underlying code for them so they'll be easier to properly implement for multiple players
• Updated suspense sounds to apply across the whole map, added more template stuff for underground sounds
• Fixed crash to desktop that happens when scene is reset using C and there is more than one actor, this could potentially be the cause of some other crashes
• Fixed alert merging so alerts no longer spawn weirdly delayed or in weird locations. Hopefully.
• Fixed medkits causing duplicate player respawns, which let the player control many actors at once in a very wonky way.
• Made alerts a lot more reliable, extensible and straightforward and modified them so they generally make more sense.
• Fixed newly thrown alerts ability to override higher priority targets so they do so more naturally and keep doing so until they stop moving (only applies to the first throw at the moment).
• Made alert zombie spawning more reasonable and sensible, so it can be balanced properly, instead of confusedly.
• Made light alerts disappear during day and reappear at night and did set up so it'll be easy to make other alert types do the same thing under certain circumstances (e.g. sound alerts during storms).
• Made celestial bodies' positions be based on the player's screen position instead of actor position, so they're less jerky and works better on map edges.
• Fixed bug where extra zombies would spawn when alerts on actors change to non-targeted alerts.
• Fixed the ability to make an absurd number of zombies by picking up and dropping/throwing activated alert items (e.g. flares and stuff).
• Added alert display system that shows alerts around players.
• Fixed zombie spawning underground/under objects so they more reliably spawn at the correct height
• Allowed alert zombie spawning to be disabled in the scene datafile to allow for maps where only special zombies should spawn
• Fixed bug where localized sounds (e.g. seagulls) would spam incessantly when the player actor was not actually selected
