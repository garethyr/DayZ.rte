//The file is divided into sections which define specific information. These sections are specified by their headers which are always prefixed by ||.
//The headers are important and care should be taken that they don't have any typos, cause those might cause silent failures
//Note that headers and their sections can be entirely omitted if they're not used, e.g. DayNight in an indoor/underground scene doesn't have to even show up in the file because it's not used.

SpawnAlertZombies = true		//This defines whether zombies willl spawn from thrown alerts in the scene, defaults to true if left empty
LeftMostSpawn = 200			//This defines how close to the scene's left boundary actors can spawn, so a value of 10 means they can't spawn at a position less than 10.
RightMostSpawn = 1250			//This defines how close to the scene's right boundary actors can spawn, so a value of 10 means they can't spawn at a position greater than width_of_scene - 10.
					//The above two are use currently for zombie safety so they don't fall off randomly and have to be figured out manually on a scene by scene basis.
